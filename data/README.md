As described on the project website, this CNN model is adapted from Edge Impulse’s open-source tutorial on sound recognition:
https://docs.edgeimpulse.com/tutorials/end-to-end/sound-recognition

Additional audio samples were randomly selected and incorporated from other open-source repositories, including Freesound (https://freesound.org
), to improve data diversity.

The zip file under data is the deployment package generated by Edge Impulse and is ready to be flashed onto the Arduino Nicla Voice. Details of how to flash can be found in the tutorial mentioned above. The full adapted Edge Impulse project corresponding to Odyssey is publicly available at:
